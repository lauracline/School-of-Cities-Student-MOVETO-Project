# School-of-Cities-Student-MOVETO-Project
This paper aims to examine the relationship between commute time as a factor in students’ postsecondary school selection and the ranking of the postsecondary institution they chose to attend, using data from the StudentMoveTO’s Fall 2019 dataset. Our hypothesis is that students’ self-reported perception that commute time impacted their school choice will be associated with attending a lower-ranked postsecondary school. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine if a student’s postsecondary school ranking was dependent on if their school choice was influenced by commute time, while controlling for network commute distance, gender, age, living situation, and family income level. Based on the results of this analysis, students that chose their postsecondary school based on commute time were more likely to attend a lower ranking school. However, our results found that family income level was also a significant predicting variable. Additionally, we found that students who were older men living with a host family or at a friend’s house were more likely to attend a lower ranking school.
